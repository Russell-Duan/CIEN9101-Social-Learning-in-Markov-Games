	"system" : "Here is a 2 by 5 grid representing the two parallel lanes (Lane 1 and Lane 2). Lane 1 (West to East) goes from (1,1) to (1,5). Lane 2 (North to South) goes from (2,1) to (2,5). A green car starts at (1,1) on Lane 1, wanting to reach X=any, Y=5. A red car starts at (2,1) on Lane 2, wanting to reach X=any, Y=5. Each car starts with a reward 0. Each car wants to maximize their cumulative reward by the end of the game\r\n\r\nAt each time step, each car chooses a move: \r\n- Go(move forward 1 grid): reward -2\r\n- Stop(not moving): reward -2\r\n- Lane(switch to the other lane, change X from 1 to 2 or from 2 to 1): reward -2\r\n\r\nIf a platoon forms (i.e. Two cars are within 3 grids apart on the same lane): reward +2 for every time step the platoon is kept. \r\nIf a collision occurs (i.e. both cars occupy the same position simultaneously): reward -5 and the game ends. \r\nIf both cars reach the goal, the game ends."
